            <p>The Khirbet Birzeit Research and Excavation project was carried out in the late 1990s by the Palestinian Institute of Archaeology at Birzeit University. The project focused on the ruins of a building on the summit of a hill about 1 km north of the University campus that was probably constructed during the Mamluk period, possibly as a local administrative centre, directly on top of the bedrock. Underneath the building, evidence for an agricultural processing site was found, represented by wine/oil presses, and dated to the Byzantine/Umayyad periods. The pottery sequence suggested continuous use of the site from the Iron Age to the Ottoman period.</p>

            <p>The Nestorian monastery on the island of Sir Bani Yas (Abu Dhabi Emirate) was first discovered in 1992. It was the first Christian monastic site to be discovered in the UAE, followed - in 2000 - by a similar site on the island of Marawah. At the time, the discovery of the monastery on Sir Bani Yas revolutionised understanding of settlement chronologies in the region, as well as the spread of early Christianity.</p>
